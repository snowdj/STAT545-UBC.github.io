### Awesome add-on packages to Shiny

Many people have written packages that enhance Shiny in some way or add extra functionality.  Here is a list of several popular packages that people often use together with Shiny:

- [shinythemes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/): Easily alter the appearance of your app
- [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs): Enhance user experience in Shiny apps using JavaScript functions without knowing JavaScript
- [leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): Add interactive maps to your apps
- [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/): Similar to ggplot2, but the plots are focused on being web-based and are more interactive
- [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/): Gives you tools to create visual “dashboards”
